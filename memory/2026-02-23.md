# 2026-02-23 — Daily Log

## Session 3 — Docker app testing marathon (~20:38–21:05 UTC)

### Disk space crisis
- VM root volume 100% full (17G LV on 35G disk — Ubuntu Server default)
- `docker system prune -a --volumes -f` freed 1.3GB
- Troy expanded LV to use full disk: `lvextend -l +100%FREE` + `resize2fs` → ~33G now

### Docker stop/uninstall fixes
- **stop!** now uses 30s timeout (`-t 30`) — Home Assistant slow to stop
- **stop!** gracefully handles "No such container" instead of erroring
- **uninstall!** uses `docker rm -f` (force) for stuck containers
- **uninstall!** now runs `docker image prune -f` to reclaim space
- Real error messages captured instead of swallowed by `2>/dev/null`
- Removed `:ro` flag from init_file bind mounts (HA needs write access)

### Full catalog audit
- **Jellyfin** → switched to `linuxserver/jellyfin` for PUID/PGID
- **Pi-hole** → added DNS port 53, better defaults
- **Home Assistant** → removed redundant file bind mount (already in volume dir)
- **Syncthing** → switched to `linuxserver/syncthing` (official image doesn't support PUID/PGID, had overlapping volume mounts)
- **Paperless-ngx** → disabled Redis requirement, added USERMAP_UID/GID
- **Immich** → DISABLED (requires PostgreSQL + Redis companion containers)
- **Uptime Kuma** → marked `proxy_mode: subdomain` (WebSocket-dependent)

### Subdomain app UI guard
- Apps with `proxy_mode: subdomain` show "🔗 Subdomain" disabled button instead of "Open"
- Tooltip explains: "Requires Cloudflare subdomain — configure in Remote Access settings"
- Data attribute `data-proxy-mode` on app row for JS access

### Multi-container support added to TODO.md (P2)
- Docker Compose per-app for apps needing companion containers
- Troy agreed it's the right long-term direction

### Commits
- `b9f41e5` through `f0fc96d` (7 commits)

### Status
- Troy actively testing apps through proxy on test.enlightenedsolutionsllc.com
- FileBrowser ✅, Syncthing ✅ (after fix), more apps in progress
