# 2026-02-17 — Native Install Coordination

## Context
- Troy vouched for root Claude Code session (running as root on the VM)
- Root Claude is executing `bin/amahi-install` on the host
- Troy is out running errands, will check back later
- Key focus: Node.js / Terser question for `assets:precompile`

## Status
- Waiting for root Claude to coordinate on issues
- Ready to advise on asset pipeline, Gemfile, installer script questions
